INTERGRID KMS SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------

How to setup a KMS server:

1. Get a latest copy of KMS server. Unpack it on your home directory.
2. Copy both /usr/local/kms and /usr/share/kms directories and files into your new KMS server.
3. Install php, and apache with php and mysql support 

   yum install httpd php php-mysql 

   - It's not necessary to install mysql-server. You can use an external mysql server for KMS.
   - It's either not necessary to install proftpd. You can use external FTP.
  
   ensure that apache starts everytime you restart the server:

   chkconfig --level 2345 httpd on

   don't forget to open 80 port...
   iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -i eth0 --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

   finaly restart httpd server:

   /etc/init.d/httpd start
 
4. Integration with Plesk

   Its highly recommended but not strictly necessary to have Plesk hosted in different server.
   To link both servers, follow this instructions:
  
   4.1. On plesk server, create an NFS mountpoint into /var/www/vhosts linked to your KMS server.
   4.2. Don't forget to copy /var/www/vhosts/.skel directory to new NFS mountpoint
   4.3. On kms server, create the appropiate plesk users:  psaserv,psaadm,psaftp


	/etc/passwd must contain something like this:

	psaftp:x:501:2521:anonftp psa user:/:/sbin/nologin
	psadm:x:502:2521:Plesk user:/usr/local/psa/admin:/sbin/nologin

	and /etc/group like this. group ID is be this!

	psaadm:x:2521:psaadm
	psaftp:x:2522:psaftp
	psacln:x:2523:apache,psaftp,psaadm
	psaserv:x:2524:

	You can rename group names psacln and psaserv if you like. What you can't change is group id :

	psaadm:x:2521:psaadm
	psaftp:x:2522:psaftp
	intergrid:x:2523:apache,psaftp,psaadm
	kms:x:2524:

	If you do that, just remember to change session directory with intergrid (psaserv) group:

	chown root:intergrid /var/lib/php/session

   4.4. Configure apache for kms :

	edit /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
	* you can use this sample : /usr/local/kms/install/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

	copy yy_kms.conf and  zz_vhosts.conf that you will find into /usr/local/kms/install/etc/httpd/conf.d/ to /etc/httpd/conf.d/
	
	edit yy_kms.conf and  zz_vhosts.conf and change the ip of your kms server

	copy and edit httpd.kms.include that you will find on /var/www/vhosts/kms.cat/conf/ for each virtual host into /var/www/vhosts/DOMAIN/conf/httpd.kms.include

	* we use httpd.kms.include to ensure that plesk doesn't overwrite this file with default plesk httpd configuration.
          this file, includes data subdomain and includes paths for kms.

 	test httpd configuration with: service httpd configtest

    4.5. Syncronize your users to kms server with the same USERID that figures on Plesk server

	useradd  -u USERID -p PASSWORD -s /bin/false -g 2523 -d /var/www/vhosts/DOMAIN USERNAME

    4.6. Add permanent ssh keys to plesk server, so it doesn't require user enter password by stdin

	 genereate on plesk server a key:
	  ssh-keygen -t dsa

	 copy this key to kms server:	
	 ssh root@a1.intergridnetwork.net "echo `ssh cp.intergridnetwork.net cat /root/.ssh/id_dsa.pub` >> .ssh/authorized_keys"

	 now you will be able to do ssh kmsserver without entering the password. This will let execute plesk event scripts.

5. Install Pear for Mail/SMTP Auth libraries

  yum install php-pear
 
  pear upgrade --alldeps pear

  pear install Mail;pear install Net_SMTP;pear install Auth_SASL;

 Add the include path your php.ini 

	include_path = ".:/usr/share/pear"

  In /usr/share/pear there must exist the Mail directory  (or where ever is installed pear. You can see it executing pear config-get php_dir).
