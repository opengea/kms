Introduction
------------

Speedy Whois allows you to create your own Whois website in minutes.  It 
is based on the phpWhois class.

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

Requirements
------------

phpWhois requires PHP 4.3.0 or better with OpenSSL support to work 
properly.  Without SSL support you will not be able to query domains 
which do not have a whois server but that have a https based whois. 
Also, you can run it in lower PHP versions but without timeout control. 
phpWhois will not work with PHP versions below 4.1.0.

If you have a firewall, open port 43 (whois) for outgoing connections.

Installation
------------

Untar this package into your website.  The files under the main 
directory of this package (index.php & whois.icon.png) should be under 
the document root.  The rest of the files you can move if you want to, 
as long as you change the includes in index.php.  You can also keep 
these files under the document root, there are no known problems or 
security risks.

When everything works, feel free to change whatever you like, including
the name of your Whois website.  It's free software!  Of course you can
link to www.speedywhois.com if you want to, but you don't have to.
